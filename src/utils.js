👋 Hey there! I’m Sarthak Upadhyay — the guy who thought, “Instead of just playing games, why not host tournaments too?”

Currently, I’m a BCA 1st-year student at Dr. Hari Singh Gour University, Madhya Pradesh. Basically, I spend half my life writing code and the other half explaining to my relatives that “No, I don’t fix printers, I’m a programmer.”

What I Actually Do 🖥️

1.I’m into web development and tech experiments. That means I build stuff like:
2.🔑 Authentication systems (yes, the serious kind with OTP and forgot-password — not just “1234” passwords).
3.✂️ Link shorteners (because typing long links is torture).
4.⚡ Tournament platforms (yep, like this one you’re on right now).
5.📡 Socket.IO chat & multiplayer systems (because silence is boring).
6.I keep leveling up my skills in React.js, Next.js, MongoDB, Redux, Socket.IO, and Remix.js. Basically, I’m collecting frameworks like Pokémon.

Why I’m Doing This 🎯

Because tournaments should be:
1.Fair → no fake entries, no secret backdoors.
2.Fun → not just another boring “register and wait” thing.
3.Trustworthy → you know exactly who’s behind the curtain (spoiler: it’s me, not some shady random admin).
So yeah, this platform is my way of combining coding + gaming + community.

A Few Random Facts ⚡
1.I like explaining complicated tech in simple words. If I can explain Redux to a class 10th student, I can definitely explain tournament rules to you.
2.I experiment a lot with digital products and side hustles. One day it’s templates, another day it’s automation. Basically, my brain doesn’t know the word “rest.”

For me, coding is not just a job skill — it’s like solving puzzles. And yes, sometimes those puzzles crash at 2 AM.

Final Words 🚀

If you’re here to play, welcome aboard!
If you’re here just to judge my About Me page… at least admit it’s better than the boring ones with “We value your trust and integrity.”
So yeah, join in, play fair, and let’s make this tournament actually fun.
